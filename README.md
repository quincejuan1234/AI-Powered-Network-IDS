# AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System

An AI-driven cybersecurity application that detects malicious network traffic using machine learning models trained on a subset of the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The system includes an interactive dashboard for threat analysis and is designed for future integration with SIEM and real-time monitoring systems.

## Overview

Cybersecurity threats such as DDoS attacks, brute-force attempts, and network intrusions are increasingly complex and difficult to detect using traditional rule-based systems.

This project implements a machine learning-based intrusion detection system that:
- classifies network traffic as benign or malicious
- detects different types of cyberattacks
- provides evaluation metrics and visualizations
- displays results through an interactive dashboard

The system is designed as both a course project and a foundation for a scalable cybersecurity platform.

## Features

- Machine learning-based intrusion detection
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualizations such as confusion matrix and performance charts
- Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
- Scalable structure for future extensions
- Future-ready design for SIEM integration and real-time monitoring

## Dataset

This project uses a subset of the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, which contains realistic network traffic data including:
- benign traffic
- DoS and DDoS attacks
- brute-force attacks
- port scanning activity

Note: Due to dataset size, raw data is not included in this repository.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Joblib
